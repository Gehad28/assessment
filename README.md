### Solution Approach

1. Navigating the code.
2. Implementing the TransactionAggregator class with its methods.
3. Implementing filter route.
3. Displaying transactions in React.
4. Creating UI inputs and buttons for filtering.
5. Fetching filterd data and display it.

#### Class Methods explaination

1. `filter_by_customer` implemented using `filter` built-in function to iterate on the transactions list and return the records required using `customer_id`.

2. `filter_by_item` implemented using a for loop to iterate on the transactions list and in each transaction loop on the items list to get only the needed item.

3. `filter_by_date` implemented using `filter` built-in function to filter the records according to a date range parsed by `datetime.strptime`.

4. `aggregate_total_revenue` implemented using `sorted` built-in function to sort the filtered trnasactions list and then use `reduce` built-in function to get the total amount.

5. `aggregate_total_item` implemented using `sorted` built-in function to sort the filtered trnasactions list and then use `reduce` built-in function to get the total quantity.
